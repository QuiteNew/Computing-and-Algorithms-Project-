# Computing-and-Algorithms-Project-

Flowgorithm is an educational application designed to help users understand the fundamentals of programming and algorithm design through visual flowcharts. It allows users to create, analyze, and execute algorithms using standardized flowchart symbols, making the logical structure of a program clear and easy to follow.
In Flowgorithm we are tasked to create a project as follows:

* The project needs to include at least 1 recursive algorithm, 1 sorting algorithm, and 1 search algorithm - decide between the members which student will work on which.
* The project needs to have different sections of the algorithms in functions (preferably, each section of each member should be a different function, however, in that function of the member there can be multiple other functions)
* Each member of the group needs to implement at least 1 function in their section of the project.
The entire project assignment should be ONE whole project, meaning all of the work of each of the group members needs to be combined into one piece.

Project file in Flowgorithm;
Project documentation in .docx (each section described, purpose, how it is useful, how it is used in the program in Flowgorithm, etc.). Documentation should include: Project requirements (what was required/used to complete the project, Project Analysis (small tutorial on usage (what, why, how, etc.)).
Project presentation in .pptx (max 10 slide)
